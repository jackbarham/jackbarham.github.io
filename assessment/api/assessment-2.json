Nerves and anxiety cause changes in your body’s biochemistry. You start to develop a “fight” or “flight” response e.g. stress and frustration because you can’t remember or you have detachment and lack of caring because it’s too overwhelming.  <br>During your PL Curriculum you will be taught clear pre-, during and -post exam routines, which will help you to maintain consistency throughout the exam.  Remember your memory is linked to your emotional state of mind, your focus determines your behaviour and your feelings determine your focus.<br>"

If you have answered “yes” or “sometimes/rarely” for the question that asked if you wake up feeling refreshed, then it is critical that during your PL Sleep Lessons you focus on your pre-sleep routine, which your PL Teacher will provide you with.  Avoiding artificial light, which is emitted from you bright screens, is crucial prior to you going to sleep. Too much exposure to artificial light before bedtime can prevent your body/brain from releasing melatonin, (the vital hormone which helps you sleep) and your body/brain stays away, thinking that it’s daylight."
